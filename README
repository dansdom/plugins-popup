 Popup/Gallery plugin by Daniel Thomson
  
  release notes: version 1.0
  version 1.1  - added support for gallery on non img object, now it just has to have the gallery name in the title attribute
   		    - added option for image caption
 			    - added option for gallery counter
 			    - added a preloader image and option for image path
  version 1.2  - got sick of trying to support syncronised animations, turned the whole popup content into a table so that the brwoser could animate the table in one go.
  version 1.3 - modified the extend method to create a new object 'opts' that doesn't destroy the settings object. I will think about creating an
 				'opts' method so that the settings can be modified outside of the script
  version 1.4 - not finished - added support for transparency hack on IE6
  version 1.5 - not sure, I think it was a bit of validation with JsLint
  version 1.6 - removed transparent layer height bug if scroll Y > 0
 			   - added option to set the opacity of the transparent layer
                - removed the $(window).unbind() method, seems not to be needed
  version 1.7 - added option to set overflow hidden off so that you can hang elements (namely the close button) outside the box
 				- added proper ajax loading
   TO DO: make an option to allow the popup to move with page scrolling	
 
  level of error suppresion -> low
  This module is designed as a popup function to use whenever and wherever you might need a popup. call this module on any DOM element you wish like this:
  $(document).ready(function(){
                        $(".yourClassNameHere").popup({
 					plugin : options,
 					go : here
 				})
          });
 
   You can link multiple popup items together to form a 'gallery'. to do this you need to set the option 'gallery' to true. Also you need to set
   the title attribute of the DOM element to the gallery name that you want. All other DOM elements with the same class and title attribute will
   be linked into the navigation structure of this gallery, and the title of this gallery will be displayed above the image in the popup box.
   galllery navigation is also bound to the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard
   the link to the popup goes onto the name attribute
   You can also control the height and width of the navigation box and title box with the following options:
   titleHeight, controlHeight
 
   Other interesting options avaliable:
   autoSize:                                    allows the box to expand and contract to the image size with an animation of the length: transition
   centerOnResize:                              will center the popup when you resize the browser window
   popupID, contentClass, closeBox:             allows custom classes and IDs for these DOM element just in case you need them for your application
   shadowLength:                                the box itself has a structure around it to allow for custom drop shadows.
                                                This value adjusts the size of this 'outer' layer of the box
   boxWidth, boxHeight:                         Sets the dimensions of the box if autoSize is false, and if content node is not an image
